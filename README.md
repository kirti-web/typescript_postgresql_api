# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

The backend will be built separately using Express. It will use a Postgres database and knex to make queries. It will use cors for protection against attacks. It will use body-parser to parse request bodies, and nodemon to watch for changes in the dev environment.

# Setup the Backend

Install all dependencies.
Create a postgres database and a db table within it.
Start the server.

# Run Frontend

You can run our App with command: npm start.
If the process is successful, open Browser with Url: http://localhost:8081/ and check it.
